2. Run the table creation queries found in sql/table creation queries.txt

Application Setup:

1. Install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt using pip
2. Modify the database credentials in db_client.py to match those for PostgreSQL on your system
3. Run either member.py for the member application, or staff.py for the staff application

SQL Directory:
table creation queries.txt contains the full list of queries I used to create all the tables in the DB
data manipulation.txt contains the queries used for data manipulation inside the program

Program Explanation:

The program is split into two modules (member.py and staff.py)

member.py will allow you to login/signup as a member and access a number of feature available to members such as registering for classes, tracking your personal records, tracking your health metrics, viewing your bills, and more.

staff.py will allow you to login or create a staff account. You will be able to add members as personal training clients, write personal training logs for members, and bill members.
